# GhostFaceNets Implementation
This is a python service for [GhostFaceNets]([url](https://github.com/HamadYA/GhostFaceNets)). Upload images of each person to the people directory, and then run the API in Postman. Set the **image** as the key and use **multipart/form-data** as the content type in the form-data section.
